# food-spoilage-detector
An IoT-based Food Spoilage Detector that uses gas sensors (MQ-4 Sensor) and temperature &amp; humidity sensors (DHT11) interfaced with a Arduino microcontroller to monitor food quality. The system analyzes sensor data in real-time to detect spoilage and alerts users through indicator modules like LED AND LCD
